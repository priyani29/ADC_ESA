        Photography has been my hobby, an escape mechanism from reality for the
        longest time. Once I have my phone I click away at everything I see and
        some of the things I've pictured commonly are Clouds or the Sky,
        Architecture, Flowers or nature and Scenery. Every picture I click is a
        memory of my emotions attached to that place at that moment.
